\section{Future Directions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bottleneck–circuit alignment.} Extend H1 batteries to all known bottlenecks (e.g., Saxe; Achille \& Soatto) to test whether extreme-tail circuits concentrate where compression is strongest.
    \item \textbf{Training dynamics.} Use Pythia checkpoints to detect phase transitions: do suppressors crystallize suddenly as the objective and geometry align?
    \item \textbf{Scaling and diversity.} Test LLaMA/Qwen families and larger GPTs: does solution diversity scale with degrees of freedom while location remains forced at early bottlenecks?
\end{enumerate}
